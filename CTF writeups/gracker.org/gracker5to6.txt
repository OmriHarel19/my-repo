nc connection.

using nmap to do port scanning according the port range the give us: nmap -p 1453-3501 127.0.0.1
this scan finds only one TCP open port: 2989.
when we nc to that port at local host we enter the string: LLLSDLaserControl (a reference to the movie TRON: legacy)
this spawns us a level6 shell.
