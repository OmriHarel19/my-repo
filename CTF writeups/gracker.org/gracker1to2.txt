same idea as before: program asks for a password.

this time when we run in gdb and break at main to look at the address (which the arg to strcmp) we get garbage.
we see in the asm that there is a xor key -> which means that each char in the password is currently encrypted and during the program it will be decrypted
by xor operation.
we set a breake to the strcmp statement and get the password: n0b0dy_gu3sses_thi5_passw0rd
