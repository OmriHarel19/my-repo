solution creating a .exe named "touch" to trick system to run our file instead of the proper command.

1. create a new dir and cd there
2. create a file named "touch" and echo to it '/bin/sh' (this is what is going to be executed)
3. remember to chmod so touch has exec preveleges
4. add the path of our new dir to PATH (so that the call to exec "touch" will work since the kernel will be looking in our path) : PATH=newdirpath:$PATH
5. exec touch to spawn a shell
