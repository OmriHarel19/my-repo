the code asks for the password -> if it is correct it spawns a shell.

solution: "eatmyshorts"
1.our password (recieved by scanf) is stored at [ebp-0x5d]
2.the correct password is stored at [ebp-0x1c] : "OK^GSYBEX^Y" 

3.memfrob(void *ptr, int (size) n) is called - memfrob([ebp-0x1c], sizeof [ebp-0x1c]):
	-this function encripts the first n bytes stored at pointer ptr (with a known xor)
	-memfrob call changes the password to -> "eatmyshorts"

4.strcmp is called compering between strings at [ebp-0x1c], [ebp-0x5d]: our string and the password
