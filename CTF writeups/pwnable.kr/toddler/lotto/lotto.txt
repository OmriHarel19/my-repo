program chooses 6 random values from /dev/urandom and then uses modulu to put in the value range: 1 to 45.
then program asks for our 6 bytes long input and compares it to the random values.
it runs a nested loop: for each byte in the chosen lotto it compares it to every single byte of our input, for every match it incriments a counter by 1.
if by the end of the check counter = 6 -> the flag is printed.
so to make the counter to be equal to 6 we only need a single value in our input to match one of the 6 values randomly chosen.
for we shall make a python script that keeps on sending the same message of 6 identical bytes (their value can be anything from 0x1 to 0x2D) to the program. becuase the random value range is pretty small 
the chances of hitting one similar byte in the input is pretty high.

we place the python script in a dir inside tmp, and create a soft link to the flag file also named "flag" (becuase the program executes: "cat flag").
when run the script stops when the flag is returned: 

sorry mom... I FORGOT to check duplicate numbers... :(
