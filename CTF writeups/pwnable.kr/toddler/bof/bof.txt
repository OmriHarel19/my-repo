a simple buffer overflow

using gets to get input. after that the program checks if its int arg is equal to 0xcafebabe -> if it does we spawn a shell
gets stores its input into [ebp0x2c] and we know that the function arg is located at [ebp+0x8] -> so we overflow the needed amount to write
oxcafebabe at [ebp+0x8] - the code for the exploit is in exploit.py

flag: daddy, I just pwned a buFFer :)
