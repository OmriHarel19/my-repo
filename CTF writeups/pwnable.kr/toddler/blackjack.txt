blackjack program!

when play the programs asks for our bet, it reads it from stdin into an int global var.
incase we lose the program subtracts our betting amount from our total, so when entering a negative value our total will increase.
the ctf prompt says they gives the flag only to millionaires so on betting we enter -1000000, and lose on purpose.
when we press play again our amount updates and we recieve the flag:

YaY_I_AM_A_MILLIONARE_LOL
